# PLAETO
## Introduction
> “How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?”

This repository contains the source for an implementation of a bachelor's thesis at the NES chair of the Duisburg-Essen University.

The repository's name is inspired from the parent project [SOCRAETES](https://github.com/SepehrMosavat/SOCRAETES), which provides an API for benchmarking bateryless sensor node energy harvesting data as well as relevant environmental parameters.

## Structure
There are two main directories that divide the structure of this project:

- plaeto_frontend: [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) App for user interaction, graphs and human-readable analysis
- plaeto_backend: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Backend service for management and API access of relevant data

## Development Procedure
In order to enable organized development, the whole process will be described in [User Stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) that are distributed across multiple milestones. These milestones are comparable to Sprints from the [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/) methodology. The aforementioned User Stories will be noted in and accessible from separate document in this git repository.
